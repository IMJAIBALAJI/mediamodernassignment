HTML entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. They are also used to display characters that cannot be typed using a standard keyboard. An HTML entity is a string that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. **Non-breaking Space (`&nbsp;`)**
   - Represents a space that will not break into a new line.
   - **Example**: `&nbsp;` →  

2. **Less Than (`&lt;`)**
   - Represents the less-than sign (<).
   - **Example**: `&lt;` → <

3. **Greater Than (`&gt;`)**
   - Represents the greater-than sign (>).
   - **Example**: `&gt;` → >

4. **Ampersand (`&amp;`)**
   - Represents the ampersand sign (&).
   - **Example**: `&amp;` → &

5. **Double Quote (`&quot;`)**
   - Represents the double quote (").
   - **Example**: `&quot;` → "

These entities help ensure that characters are displayed correctly in the browser and prevent conflicts with the HTML syntax.
