Using semantic tags in a webpage provides several significant benefits, enhancing the overall functionality, accessibility, and searchability of the content. Here are the key benefits:

### 1. **Improved Accessibility**
Semantic tags help assistive technologies like screen readers to better interpret and navigate the content. By using meaningful tags, you provide a clear structure that helps users with disabilities understand the layout and purpose of different sections on a webpage.

- **Example**: `<nav>` indicates a navigation section, `<article>` signals a standalone piece of content, and `<footer>` designates the footer of a document.

### 2. **Enhanced SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**
Search engines use semantic tags to better understand the content and structure of a webpage. This can improve the indexing and ranking of your site in search engine results.

- **Example**: Using `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` tags helps search engines identify and prioritize important content, making your site more likely to appear in relevant searches.

### 3. **Better Code Readability and Maintainability**
Semantic tags make HTML code more readable and easier to maintain. Developers can quickly understand the structure and purpose of different sections of the webpage, facilitating collaboration and future updates.

- **Example**: It is easier to understand `<main>` as the primary content area compared to a `<div>` with an ambiguous class name.

### 4. **Consistent Structure**
Using semantic tags encourages a consistent structure across web pages, promoting best practices in web development. This consistency can be particularly beneficial in large projects with multiple developers.

- **Example**: Standardizing the use of `<article>` for blog posts or news items ensures a uniform approach to content organization.

### 5. **Future-Proofing**
Semantic HTML is more likely to be compatible with future web technologies and standards. As web standards evolve, having a well-structured and semantically meaningful HTML document ensures better adaptability and longevity.

- **Example**: Browsers and new web technologies will continue to support and enhance features for semantic tags, ensuring your website remains robust and functional over time.

### Practical Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Semantic HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Website Title</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <article>
      <h2>Article Title</h2>
      <p>This is the content of the article...</p>
    </article>
    <section>
      <h2>Section Title</h2>
      <p>This section contains additional information...</p>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website</p>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are used to clearly define the structure and purpose of different parts of the webpage, showcasing all the aforementioned benefits.
